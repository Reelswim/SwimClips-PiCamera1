# SwimClips-PiCamera1
Python code for SwimClips video recorder. Based on PiCamera1 and Raspivid. This codebase is one part of the codebase for the RPi based video recording boxes used in SwimClips. While this represents all of the Python based code for the recording boxes that will need to be ported to PiCamera2/Libcamera, it likely cannot be fully understood without the other recording box code.
